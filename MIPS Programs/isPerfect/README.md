A MIPS program which:-

  (a) reads an integer with the prompt "Enter a positive integer:"
  
  (b) checks whether or not it is a perfect number i.e., whether its factors including 1 and excluding itself sum to itself, and
  
  (c) accordingly prints the message "entered number is (not) a perfect number."
